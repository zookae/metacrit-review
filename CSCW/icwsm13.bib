@book{Benkler2006Wealth,
	Abstract = {With the radical changes in information production that the Internet has
introduced, we stand at an important moment of transition, says Yochai Benkler
in this thought-provoking book. The phenomenon he describes as social
production is reshaping markets, while at the same time offering new
opportunities to enhance individual freedom, cultural diversity, political
discourse, and justice. But these results are by no means inevitable: a
systematic campaign to protect the entrenched industrial information economy
of the last century threatens the promise of today's emerging networked
information environment.

In this comprehensive social theory of the Internet and the networked
information economy, Benkler describes how patterns of information, knowledge,
and cultural production are changing---and shows that the way information and
knowledge are made available can either limit or enlarge the ways people can
create and express themselves. He describes the range of legal and policy
choices that confront us and maintains that there is much to be gained---or
lost---by the decisions we make today.},
